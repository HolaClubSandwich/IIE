                    Ms. Lu was a teacher at a well-known middle school in China; she has complete experience in teaching
                    and classroom management in middle school from junior high school to senior high school and has
                    received various honors. After studying abroad, she obtained a master's degree in education in
                    Canada, with a dissertation in the field of school management; her doctoral research topic was
                    student leadership in the field of student development, and she successfully passed the
                    comprehensive examination, the biggest challenge in the midterm stage of the Canadian doctorate,
                    and was qualified as a doctoral candidate because of her solid basic academic theory. She was the
                    only researcher specializing in student leadership at Canadian universities. Ms. Lu continued her
                    high school teaching and student management in Toronto.<br><br>Although moving to Toronto interfered
                    with the progress of her doctoral dissertation, she continues to be involved in several Canadian and
                    international research projects.<br><br>Ms. Lu comprehends the characteristics and difficulties of
                    adolescent development. Her years of teaching and student management experience in high schools in
                    Canada and China and her solid and cutting-edge theoretical foundation in Chinese and Western
                    student development have contributed to Ms. Lu's outstanding education and student leadership style.
                    Over the past 20 years, Ms. Lu has helped numerous children with her professionalism and character,
                    nurturing their academic victory and positive growth in all aspects.<br><br>Ms. Lu welcomes visitors
                    from all over the world, particularly those of you who share the same frequency! We look forward to
